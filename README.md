**Job Extractor Bot**

*Introduction*

The Job Extractor Bot is an automated tool designed to extract job listings from websites and save them into an Excel file. This project is developed purely for educational purposes, helping learners understand web scraping techniques using Selenium and data storage using Apache POI in Java. The tool can fetch details such as:

1.Job Title

2.Company Name

3.Location

4.Salary (CTC)

5.Recruiter Email

6.Job Link

7.Job Description

âš  **Disclaimer**: This project is strictly for educational purposes only. It is not intended for any unauthorized or unethical web scraping activities. Ensure compliance with the terms and conditions of any website before using scraping techniques.

*Features*

Web Scraping: Uses Selenium WebDriver to extract job details from websites.

Data Storage: Saves extracted data into an Excel sheet (job_listings.xlsx).

Error Handling: Handles missing values gracefully by assigning default values.

Utility-based Design: Organized structure with separate classes for scraping and data writing.

Prevent Instantiation: Utility classes (JobExtractor and ExcelWriter) follow best practices by having private constructors.
